(Baby)
It's so long when he's involved
Like I said it ain't his fault (baby)
You is what is birth taught
Never leave it unresolved
Say you chasing through the night
You're far safer by his side
I'm surprised you're still alive (to be honest though)
Know you loved him least he tried

[Bridge]
No se donde ir
No se donde puedo
Sigo sonriendo
Andando por el fuego
Es gracias a ti
Ya no tengo miedo
Nunca de mis sueños
Ni de mi infierno

[Chorus]
It's so long when he's involved
Like I said it ain't his fault (baby)
You what is birth taught
Never leave it unresolved
Say you chasing through the night
You're far safer by his side
I'm surprised you're still alive (to be honest though)
Know you loved him least he
